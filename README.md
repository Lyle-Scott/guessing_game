The Avengers guessing game asks the user to guess which Avenger is the favorite.

If the user guesses wrong, the game will ask repeatedly until the user gives the correct answer.
Version 1.1 changed case sensitivity.
Version 1.2 added variable names for Avengers.
Version 1.3 cleaned up code, finished adding variable names for Avengers, added loop so game ends after several turns.
Verison 1.4 Fixed syntax errors (changed ; to : where appropriate after case)
Version 2.0 Put the game inside an object method. Now we are able to pass the number of tries we start at out of 5.
