		<h3>Game instructions:</h3>
		<p>This is a simple game that's mostly self explanatory. You'll have to try to guess which one of the Avengers is my favorite. If you guess correctly, you will receive a wonderful infusion of the special, empty kind of satisfaction that one receives upon the correct yet arbitrary completion of a task that does not demonstrate unusual talent or skill in any particular personal aptitude. Kudos to you!</p>
